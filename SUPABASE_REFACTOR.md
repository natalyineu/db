# Supabase Client Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring done to improve the Supabase client implementation in the codebase.

## Changes Made

1. **Implemented a robust singleton pattern**
   - Consolidated client creation in `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`
   - Added TypeScript typing for the singleton instance
   - Added environment variable validation

2. **Centralized exports**
   - Updated `src/lib/supabase/index.ts` to export all Supabase-related functions
   - Re-exported common types from `@supabase/supabase-js`
   - Created proper public API through a single entry point

3. **Added utilities**
   - Created `src/lib/supabase/utils.ts` with helper functions
   - Added debug logging helpers for development
   - Provided consistent client access patterns

4. **Updated components and hooks**
   - Added comments to clarify the singleton pattern usage
   - Ensured consistent imports across the codebase
   - Fixed client creation in profile and auth hooks

5. **Improved documentation**
   - Added README.md with usage examples and best practices
   - Created this refactoring document
   - Added inline comments explaining the implementation

## Benefits

- **Reduced duplicate client instances**: The singleton pattern ensures only one Supabase client is created per environment
- **Consistent API**: All components now access Supabase through the same patterns
- **Better maintainability**: Centralized configuration and error handling
- **Improved performance**: Prevents unnecessary client creation and auth state management
- **Type safety**: Added proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Backward Compatibility

All existing imports should continue to work:

- `import { createBrowserClient } from '@/lib/supabase'`
- `import { createServerClient } from '@/lib/supabase'`
- `import { createAdminClient } from '@/lib/supabase'`

## Next Steps

1. Update all components to use the new utilities
2. Gradually migrate to the hook-based approach where appropriate
3. Consider implementing a custom error handling system
4. Add unit tests for the Supabase client wrappers
