# Refactoring Summary

## Completed Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Modularized Large Files

#### useBriefForm.ts (723 lines → 260 lines)
- Split into separate utility functions and core hook logic
- Created several focused files:
  - `types.ts`: Type definitions and interfaces
  - `useImpressionLimit.ts`: Logic for getting impression limits
  - `useBriefFormValidation.ts`: Form validation logic
  - `useBriefFormTransform.ts`: Data transformation utilities

#### KpiDashboardContainer.tsx (334 lines → ~150 lines)
- Extracted data fetching into `useKpiData.ts` hook
- Extracted metrics calculations into `useMetricsCalculation.ts` hook
- Simplified the main component to focus on rendering

#### loading-animation.css (574 lines → modular files)
- Split into several focused CSS files:
  - `keyframes.css`: Animation keyframes
  - `animation-classes.css`: Animation class definitions
  - `robot-components.css`: Robot-specific styling
  - `ui-components.css`: UI component styling
  - `index.css`: Central import file

### 2. Cleaned Up File Structure

- Moved SQL migration files to a dedicated `/src/migrations` directory
- Created documentation for migrations and removed unused SQL files from active code
- Created metrics documentation in `/docs/metrics-mapping.md`
- Consolidated duplicate ESLint configuration files

### 3. Created Documentation

- `/docs/metrics-mapping.md`: Complete documentation of metrics tracking system
- `/src/migrations/README.md`: Documentation for SQL migration files

## Future Refactoring Opportunities

The following files still exceed 200 lines and could be further refactored:

1. `src/services/campaign-service.ts` (277 lines)
2. `src/components/ui/CampaignItem.tsx` (257 lines)
3. `src/features/auth/hooks/useAuth.tsx` (254 lines)
4. `src/features/campaigns/components/CampaignForm.tsx` (246 lines)
5. `src/app/data/page.tsx` (239 lines)
6. `src/features/campaigns/hooks/useCampaigns.tsx` (225 lines)
7. `src/app/api/get-profile-direct/route.ts` (216 lines)
8. `src/app/data/components/BriefForm.tsx` (212 lines)

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to update and debug
2. **Better Code Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
3. **Enhanced Readability**: Each file has a clear, single responsibility
4. **Simplified Testing**: Isolated functions and components are easier to test
5. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can understand the codebase more quickly

## Approach for Future Refactoring

1. Identify large files (>200 lines)
2. Extract utility functions to separate files
3. Split complex components into smaller sub-components
4. Create custom hooks for complex state management
5. Maintain consistent naming conventions and documentation
